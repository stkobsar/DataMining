This repository has the activities carried out in the Advanced Data Mining Course in the Master Degree of Data Science coursed in UOC (Open University of Catalunya). It contains different jupyter notebooks covering different and interesting topics in Data Mining, Artificial Inteligence and Data Processing.  

## Data processing

Throughout this practice we will see how to apply different techniques for data loading and preparation:

1. Loading a data set
2. Data analysis
3. Basic statistical analysis
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Dimensionality reduction (sklearn PCA)
6. Training and testing
